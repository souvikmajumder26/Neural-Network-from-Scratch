    # > rand gives values from a uniform distribution in range [0, 1) with mean 0.5,
    # we subtract the values by 0.5 to make the mean 0 for two main reasons - to maintain symmetry in the network, and if we pass
    # the values of weights in the range [0, 1), i.e., all positive numbers, then all of the unit outputs will go through the
    # activation function linearly as we have used ReLU which is basically y = max(0, x), and we do not want that since activation function
    # is present to introduce non-linearity in the network and learn the non-linear relationship between the input features and the output labels.
    # this helps in preventing saturation in the activation function, which can happen when weights are initialized to large values.
    # additionally, a symmetrical distribution ensures that the activations at the output layer will be roughly balanced,
    # avoiding early convergence to a sub-optimal solution.
    # > randn gives values from a standard normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1,
    # but it is not bounded due to which convergence or improvement in performance takes longer.
    # > initializing the weights to zero will lead all the neurons to learn the same features, which is not expected.
